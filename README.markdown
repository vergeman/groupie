#Get Together (was Groupie)
A Ruby on Rails project to help groups plan a night out.

Sick of the email chain?  Indecision and a cluttered inbox?  Get Together seeks to centralize 
planning for a group of friends, so they can vote, and decide on their night out.  Add restaurants
or bars, and have your group vote on them to democratize the decision process.
