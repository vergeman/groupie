#Get Together
A Ruby on Rails project to help groups plan a night out.

Sick of the email chain?  Indecision and a cluttered inbox?  Get Together seeks to centralize 
planning for a group of friends so they can vote on where to have a night out on the town.  

Search for restaurants or bars, add them to your event, forward your invite out to your friends,
and let the group vote to reach a consensus and democratize the decision process.
