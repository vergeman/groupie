Hi, <%= @user.username %>

You've created a <%= @project_name %> for <%= @event.title %> <%= @event.event_date.nil? ? "" : " on " + @event.event_date.strftime("%A, %b. #{@event.event_date.day.ordinalize} at %l:%M %p.") %>

Forward this email to your friends.  They will then be able to suggest places to go and vote on their favorite spots.  

The polls are open!  <%= link_to "Vote now.", url_for(:host => @host, :controller => "events", :action => "show", :id => @event.id, :invite => @event.event_key) %> 

Best,
The <%= @project_name %> Team.
