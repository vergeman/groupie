Hi!

<p>You've been invited to <%= @event.title %> 
	<%= @event.event_date.nil? ? "" : " on " + @event.event_date.strftime("%A, %b. #{@event.event_date.day.ordinalize} at %I:%M %p") %> by <%= @user.email %>.

	But your help is needed to decide where to eat! 

	<%= link_to "Suggest a restaurant and help decide where to go!", url_for(:host => @host, :controller => "events", :action => "show", :id => @event.id, :invite => @event.event_key) %>
