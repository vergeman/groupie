Hi!

You've been invited to <%= @event.title %> 
<%= @event.event_date.nil? ? "" : " on " + @event.event_date.strftime("%A, %b. #{@event.event_date.day.ordinalize} at %l:%M %p") %> by <%= @user.email %>.

But your help is needed to decide where to eat! 

<%= link_to "Suggest a restaurant and help decide where to go!", url_for(:host => @host, :controller => "events", :action => "show", :id => @event.id, :invite => @event.event_key) %> 

Current Event Details

What: <%= @event.title %>
When: <%= @event.event_date.nil? ? "" : " on " + @event.event_date.strftime("%A, %b. #{@event.event_date.day.ordinalize} at %l:%M %p") %>
<%= @event.places.empty? ? "" : "Where:" + @user.username + "suggested" + @event.places.map{|p| p.name }.to_sentence() %>

Do you want to suggest a venue? Do you like one of these places better than the other? Then get voting and voice your opinion before the polls close!

Go in peace,
The Get Together Team.
